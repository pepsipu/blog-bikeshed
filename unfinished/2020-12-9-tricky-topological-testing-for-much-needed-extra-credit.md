As an occasional Instagram doomscroller, I've encountered this sort of ad more than a few times.

Although I love the disingenuity of more corporations exploiting "nerd sniping" to boost consumer engagement and downloads, they're definitely a little late to the party.

An Instagram ad certianly wasn't enough to send me down the rabbit hole of topology and complex analysis, but recently, in my math class, we were given the following problem for one point of extra credit.

![problem](https://i.gyazo.com/fdf711d47f045628ca7c5edfc5deb617.png)

<small>_Can you connect each pair of dots without passing through the box or other connections?_</small>

This problem, to me anyways, was tricky! Although I couldn't find the solution in class, I wanted to try to generalize this problem. What about N points on any surface? Even better, can we write an efficient algorithm to test for the solvability for a generalized connection problem, or perhaps even solve it?

There's too many questions with not many answers, so let's dive right in.

## Approaching The Puzzle

The first step with any puzzle is to play with it. Let's try some weirder surfaces and make some observations.

![lol](https://i.gyazo.com/6d9937e9287082c1e22012f739897499.png)

Let's take a look at this croissant looking shape. There's a few things to notice here:

- Blue looks awfully easy to connect.
- Yellow looks even easier.
- Dots on the border just look.. plain harder to connect.
- If our croissant looked like this, not much would change.
  ![lol](https://i.gyazo.com/dee83fd8d62dd7f29b4be3839d70639c.png)

From our recorded observations, there's two notable takeaways:

- There seems to be a difference between points on the border and points off the border.
- Some changes to the surface don't change the solvability of the problem.

This inspires a few questions! First, what's the difference between off and on border point pairs? Does moving a point off or on a border change solvability? What changes to the surface change solvability?

Let's tackle one at a time. First, let's look at how different surfaces affect the solvability of the problem.

## Surfaces Affecting Solvability

We've noticed that there exist ways to modify a surface such that it doesn't affect the solvability of the problem. It would then follow that we'd need to figure out what modifications to the surface cause a problem set to go from _solvable_ to _unsolvable_.

The answer, surprisingly, lies deep within the realm of complex analysis. Let's take a look.

_Theorem: If point pairs P are solvable on a proper non-empty simply connected open subset of C, P is solvable on **every** proper non-empty simply connected open subset of C._

Woah, bold claim, I know. Essentially, what we're saying if we can draw the P's solution on one surface, it implies we can draw P's solution on any surface! Well, how is this possible?

Let's make the question more rigorous. What we're essentially saying is that there exists some transformation from from S1 to S2 such that non-intersecting curves drawn on S1 _stay_ non-intersecting after the transformation. How do we prove this?

### Conformal Maps

If you're familiar with complex analysis, you've likely heard of _[conformal maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map)_. If not, conformal maps are a special type of transformation from one complex set to another complex set such that _angles_ and _orientations_ are preserved. This means two intersecting lines will also intersect at the same angle after the transformation, even if these lines get distorted.

![A conformal map](https://i.gyazo.com/5ade11d5e37cca26d0bcbf446fb2f067.png)

However, there's absolutely no reason conformal maps need to ensure that non-crossing lines will stay non-crossing. We'd need a new transformation with a slighlty stricter definition to prove this.

### Biholomorphic Maps

Enter the _[biholomorphic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biholomorphism)_, a specific type of conformal map whose inverse map, the map which reverses the effect of the original map, is also conformal. Let's try to prove that this transformation will not cross non-crossing lines!

We'll do this with contradiction. Let's say we have a biholomorphic map M : A -> B st. A, B e C. Assume M causes non-crossing lines in A to cross in B. It would then follow that M^-1(M(A)) would uncross those lines since A has no crossed lines. However, since M^-1 is a conformal map, crossing lines would need cross at the same angle they were originally intersecting at. Therefore, M cannot cause non-crossing lines in A to cross in B, and as a result cannot cause a problem set to go from solvable to unsolvable! Of course, since M is conformal, it can't uncross lines either, which means an unsolvable set won't become solvable after applying M.

Cool! Now that we've proved biholomorphic maps don't change the solvability of a problem set on different surfaces, we just need to prove a biholomorphic map exists between those surfaces. How do we do that?

### The Riemann Mapping Theorem

The [Riemann mapping theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_mapping_theorem) states that for every proper non-empty simply connected open subset of the complex plane (what we've been calling a surface), there exists a biholomorphic mapping from that subset to the unit disk. Consider the mappings guarenteed by the RMT for both A and B, which we'll call M_a and M_b respectively. Applying M_b^-1(M_a(A)) will take A to B, without affecting solvability.

<small>_Example of Riemann mapping_</small>

Therefore, any problem set solvable on one surface is solvable on every other surface! Pretty neat, huh?

<small>A bit of a nitpick, but RMT only applies to _open_ subsets without a boundary. However, you might have noticed that our surfaces contain points on the boundary, so we need to ensure we have a mapping which includes the boundary. [Carath√©odory's theorem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_theorem_(conformal_mapping)>) tells us that the mapping will still exists as long as the boundary is a [Jordan curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve#Jordan). We won't get into the specifics of Jordan curves, but essentialy this means that our boundary must be a closed loop with no self intersection. Since all our surfaces have this property, RMT still applies.</small>

## Point Pair Classification

Let's work on the unit disk now since it's the simplest surface we can find and play with the different types of point pairs.

![CC point circle](https://i.gyazo.com/c43aa8d08b81cfa45a84b71b11e22cde.png)
![DD point circle](https://i.gyazo.com/4f17fe34eac143c39ed9c678ebcea161.png)

One is clearly solvable, the other isn't. Well, why? On the first image, all the points are on the border, so it "slices" the circle into two pieces when we connect a pair. How exactly this path is constructed doesn't really matter, in the end, we end up with two slices.

In the second, the circle isn't divided at all! When we connect the second pair, we're able to go _around_ the first pair's path. This isn't possible when the points are on the border, since we hit the border of the surface when trying to go around the first path.

Let's make this property rigorous. We'll need to classify our point pairs, so lets list them out and give them cute names.

- In the first case, both points in the pair are on the boundary of the surface. Let's call these points conjoint-conjoint, or CC.
- In the second case, one point is on the surface boundary and the second is off it. Let's call these points conjoint-disjoint, or CD. Without loss of generality, we can assume that CD = DC, since the point pairs are reflexive.
- In the last case, both points are off the surface boundary. They'll be called disjoint-disjoint, or DD.

As we discussed, some point pairs have the property that we can go _around_ their path. For DD pairs, since both points are not attached to the surface boundary, any pair P's connection that _would_ pass through a DD pair's connection can be wrapped around the path, like so:
![](https://i.gyazo.com/98444cd9d6020ee2826587902a039cec.png)

Alright, let's formalize this a bit.

_Lemma: DD points do not affect the solvability of a problem set._

We'll prove this by contradiction. First, let's say we have a set of point pairs, P, on a surface S. We can connect all the points P on the surface S without intersection. We'll start by assuming that the addition of D, some DD pair, to P causes the set to be unsolvable on S. Let's show why this is impossible.

Draw a straight line between each point in the DD pair. Odds are, you'll intersect some another path between other pairs on the surface with this line. That's ok! The crux in proving that we can "fix" these intersecting paths to not intersect is by designing a "wrapping" algorithm which will "wrap" the intersecting paths around the DD pair's path.

This is _very_ confusing, so here's an example generated with a program

Let's design this algorithm. First, consider two intersecting paths.
![](https://i.gyazo.com/225453c8cb414ab467a6044c5e3ba910.png)

_Red is a DD pair, blue is some path_

This is no good! How can we "fix" the blue line? Well, since it's a DD pair and there's a finite amount of space between the point and the border, maybe we can curl the blue line around the red one? If we bring the blue line super close to the red one, infinitely close, then hug the red line all the way around the line, all the way back to the point of intersection, we'll be able to fix a line. It's a confusing process, so it'll make more sense with a visual.

Let the first line come infinitely close to the second:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/13e951a857f48b90805283fbba9ee02c.png)

Hug the wall of the second line until the point of intersection:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/1327e813b0027b27f1d26f7985bdc23c.png)

We can prove that wrapping will _always_ turn a path intersecting a DD path into a non-intersecting path through this method. Since lines have zero width, no matter how many lines we have running between a disjoint point and a border, we'll always have enough space to wrap.

It's important to note that is process can be repeated for any number of lines. If, in the process of wrapping a DD path, we intersect a second path wrapping the same path, we can then _wrap the second path_ too, recursively wrapping whatever gets in our way. This means that regardless of the current paths drawn on S, the addition of this new pair will _never_ change solvability. By induction, DD pairs can be ignored!

## Point Pairs on the Unit Circle

Now that we've established a method for moving between arbitrary surfaces, let's work on the unit circle. It'll allow us to more clearly work with the CD and DD points, since those depend on the boundary of the surface.

_Lemma: CD points do not affect the solvability of the problem set._

This one's going to be a little trickier to prove! However, we'll use contradiction into induction once again. Let's assume the addition of the CD point does affect the solvability of a problem set.
