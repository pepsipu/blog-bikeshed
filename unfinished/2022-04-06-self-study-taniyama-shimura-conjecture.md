## Introduction

The proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, or modularity theorem, has been one of the most important breakthroughs in modern math. It's been used to prove Fermat's last theorem and provides a rich new way to analyze elliptic curves. As a CTF player, the ubiquity of elliptic curves and their associated problems makes understanding their theory crucial to solving cryptography problems.

Unfortunately, you might notice that modern math is _really_ complicated. If you're looking to self study the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, buckle up, because there's going to be a lot of background info you're going to need to build.

### What is the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture?

In short, for every elliptic curve, there exists an associated modular form.
